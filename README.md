# banking
A complete analysis for predicting banking behavior by the classification method.

Here, I utilized Machine Learning (classification) algorithms to predict the banking behavior based on 41188 observations and 20 features. 

The data was obtained from the UCI data resource http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing

This project serves as two purposes:

1. Explore data analysis to achieve the best prediction (best modeling) of for classification. 

2. Test the python module that I have developed to automatically pick the best ML algorithm and the best hyperparameters from a large list of Sklearn library. It serves as a prototype for feature selections and hyperparameter tuning. I have obtained very good prediction (accuracy=0.92 and AUC=0.74) which is significantly better than the prediction (accuracy=0.88 and AUC=0.69) found from the public domain https://towardsdatascience.com/building-a-logistic-regression-in-python-step-by-step-becd4d56c9c8
